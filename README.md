# Proto-Shooter

A text based shooter using die rolls and fixed values with a scrolling log window

The idea was inspired by an old playstation game called "Ring of Red" as well as the classic "Zork"

This was created as a proff of concept and I may or may not continue to work on it, adding in movement and melee attacks, etc
